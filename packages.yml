# Before the change/deletion of an overlay in this YAML, make sure
# to first remove _all_ packages that depend on said overlay from this YAML and
# to run the GitHub Actions workflow to apply the deletion on branch "overlay".
#
# Then, you can add the new overlay and the previously deleted packages
# to this YAML and run the GitHub Actions workflow again
# to add the packages from the new overlay to branch "overlay".
#
# The same applies if you keep overlays unchanged,
# but want to fetch a package, for example, from "kde" instead of "guru".
# In that case, delete the package in the YAML, run the workflow,
# add the package (this time from "kde") to the YAML and run the workflow.
#
# This procedure could be avoided, by extending the logic behind
# git-merge-subpath.sh, but I don't expect for overlay changes
# to happen often and want to keep the script simple for now.
